## Why Use Real Film Grain?
 
Film grain is the natural texture and noise that you see in analog film. It is caused by the random arrangement of silver halide crystals in the film emulsion. Film grain can add character, depth, and realism to your footage, as well as create a nostalgic and vintage feel.
 
However, not all film grains are created equal. Some film grains are computer-generated, which means they are artificially added to your footage using algorithms. These grains can look fake, uniform, and repetitive, and can also degrade the quality of your footage.
 
Real film grain, on the other hand, is taken from actual film scans. This means that you get the authentic and organic look of real film, with all its imperfections and variations. Real film grain can also enhance the color and contrast of your footage, as well as create interesting effects such as flicker, hair, dirt, and scratches.

## How to Use Gorilla Grain Super Pack?
 
The Gorilla Grain Super Pack is compatible with any non-linear editor that supports H.264 or Apple ProRes formats. To use it, simply place the grain clip over your footage in the timeline and change the blending mode of the grain to "Overlay". You can also adjust the opacity of the grain to control its intensity.
 
The pack includes 21 different film grains to suit any scene or style. The 35mm and 16mm grains come in three densities: fine, medium, and coarse. Within each density, you can choose from clean, muddy (with hair and dirt), or dirty (with hair, dirt, and flicker) versions. The vintage grain is a unique and rare film accident that resulted in crazy colors and wicked imperfections. You can use it to create a retro and artistic look for your footage.
 
The pack also includes a bonus 4K grain clip that you can use for higher-resolution projects. The clip is loopable and can be scaled up or down to fit your footage.
